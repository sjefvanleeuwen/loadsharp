```

### 3. GitHub Pages (Optional)
```
Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push all changes to your GitHub repository
2. **Configure Settings**: Set up the repository permissions and secrets above
3. **Trigger Pipeline**: Push to main branch or create a PR to trigger workflows
