## 🔧 CRITICAL: Repository Settings Required

**YOU MUST configure these GitHub repository settings immediately:**

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
🌐 **Go to:** `https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/loadsharp/settings/pages`

**Configure:**
- **Source:** Select `GitHub Actions` ⚠️ **CRITICAL - NOT "Deploy from a branch"**
- Click **Save**

### 2. Set Workflow Permissions
🌐 **Go to:** `https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/loadsharp/settings/actions`

**Configure:**
- ☑️ **Workflow permissions:** `Read and write permissions`
- ☑️ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
- Click **Save**

## 📊 Expected Results

### Timeline
1. **Configure repository settings** (2 minutes)
2. **GitHub Actions workflow runs** (3-5 minutes)
3. **Pages deployment completes** (2-5 minutes)
4. **Site becomes accessible** (1-10 minutes for DNS)

**Total: 5-20 minutes**

### What You'll See
- ✅ **Actions tab:** `Quick Pages Fix` workflow running/completed
- ✅ **Pages URL:** `https://sjefvanleeuwen.github.io/loadsharp/` shows content
- ✅ **Professional documentation site** with LoadSharp info

## 🔍 Monitor Progress

### Check Workflow Status
🌐 **Actions:** `https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/loadsharp/actions`

Look for:
- ✅ `Quick Pages Fix` workflow (should be running/completed)
- ✅ Green checkmarks on all jobs
- ✅ "Deploy to GitHub Pages" step completed

### Verify Pages Deployment
🌐 **Pages Settings:** `https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/loadsharp/settings/pages`

Should show:
- ✅ "Your site is live at https://sjefvanleeuwen.github.io/loadsharp/"
- ✅ Last deployment timestamp

## 🚨 If Still 404 After Settings Configuration

### Debugging Steps
1. **Check workflow logs** in Actions tab
2. **Verify permissions** are set correctly
3. **Try manual workflow trigger:**
   - Go to Actions → Quick Pages Fix
   - Click "Run workflow"

### Alternative: Disable Other Doc Workflows
If conflicts occur:
```bash
# Temporarily rename other documentation workflows
git mv .github/workflows/documentation.yml .github/workflows/documentation.yml.disabled
git mv .github/workflows/simple-docs.yml .github/workflows/simple-docs.yml.disabled
git commit -m "Disable conflicting doc workflows"
git push origin main
```
